# arduino_beard_christmas
A simple project using attiny85 to control 16 leds that were placed in my beard for a fun look during chrismas. It includes the schematics for all the components.

It has a single button to cycle between the modes: always on, blinking, pulsing fast and pulsing slow. The power source was 2 lipo batteries in series providing around 8 volts, that the attiny85 knows how to regulate to 5 volts. The led's analog control was made with a IRF530.
